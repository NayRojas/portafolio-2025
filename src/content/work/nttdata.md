Over six years at NTT DATA, I contributed to the digital transformation of major financial institutions in Peru. As a frontend developer, I worked on large-scale applications for the banking sector, focusing on performance, scalability, and user-centered design. I developed secure, maintainable components using Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, and Sass, while collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring high-impact products to life.

This role challenged me to grow not only technically, but strategically—balancing clean code practices with real business constraints. I learned to make architectural decisions, mentor junior developers, and deliver solutions aligned with both user needs and institutional objectives.

#### A Journey of Professional Growth

My experience at NTT DATA was a foundational chapter in my career. It shaped my engineering mindset and exposed me to agile methodologies such as Scrum, SAFe, and Kanban. I participated in fast-paced project cycles where adaptability, proactive problem-solving, and communication were essential to delivering high-quality software.

#### Enabling Knowledge-Sharing Communities

Beyond project delivery, I played an active role in building and scaling **knowledge communities** within the company. I helped plan and facilitate internal workshops, implemented collaborative spaces to share best practices, and contributed to the evolution of internal workflows. These communities were instrumental in fostering innovation, upskilling talent, and creating a supportive space for continuous improvement.

By championing new ways of working and creating opportunities for peer learning, I helped cultivate a culture of technical excellence and collaboration—values that continue to shape my approach to work today.
