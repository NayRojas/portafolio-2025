During my time at BCP (Banco de Crédito del Perú), I contributed to several critical initiatives that power the digital experience for millions of users. As part of the frontend development team, I was involved in projects that required security, scale, and stability—working on services that are foundational to the bank’s online ecosystem.

#### Key Projects: CIAM, Login Web & Homebanking

- **CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management):**  
  I helped build and maintain the web components and flows that ensure secure and seamless login experiences. This included working on OAuth-based login mechanisms, UI components for identity validation, and user session handling in a modular and secure way.

- **Login Único Web:**  
  I collaborated on the implementation of a unified login solution that streamlined authentication across various BCP products and platforms, ensuring consistency and reducing friction for end users.

- **Homebanking (Banca por Internet):**  
  I worked on refining the digital banking interface, focusing on performance, responsive design, and accessibility.s

#### Technical and Strategic Impact

In these roles, I applied frontend technologies such as Angular. I emphasized modularity, reusability, and secure coding practices. My work also contributed to reducing support incidents, improving performance, and aligning web components with BCP’s design system.

These experiences strengthened my ability to deliver at scale, collaborate with large multidisciplinary teams, and develop secure, high-performance web interfaces for one of the largest financial institutions in the region.
