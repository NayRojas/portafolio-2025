At [CIX BCP](https://www.viabcp.com/cix-bcp), the Innovation Center of Banco de Crédito del Perú, I’m stepping into a space where creativity, experimentation, and business impact intersect. As a frontend developer, I will be contributing to projects that rethink the digital banking experience—placing user needs and business goals at the heart of every decision.

My responsibility is to design and implement performant, accessible, and intuitive interfaces that support millions of daily users. This means going beyond code: understanding real people, their behaviors, and the challenges they face in managing their finances. By combining frontend technologies like Angular, TypeScript, and micro-frontend architectures with user-centric design principles, I’ll help build scalable applications that are both human and high-performing.

What makes CIX truly unique is its mindset: here, innovation is not an abstract goal—it’s a method. Every product is designed with user insight and business value in mind. We build with purpose, not just functionality. The development process is deeply collaborative, informed by data, guided by empathy, and constantly iterated to align with evolving market needs.

Joining CIX represents a transformative step in my career. It’s an opportunity to expand my technical and strategic thinking, while working at the forefront of Peru’s digital banking evolution. This role empowers me to contribute to a larger mission: making financial services more inclusive, intelligent, and intuitive—one interface at a time.
