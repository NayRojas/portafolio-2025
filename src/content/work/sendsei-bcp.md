  Transforming Remittances Through Technology

At [Sendsei](https://sendseibcp.com/), I’ve been part of a bold initiative to redefine how cross-border remittances work from Peru to the world. Backed by BCP and operating as an agile fintech project, Sendsei has allowed me to combine cutting-edge technology with deep user empathy in order to serve thousands of families that rely on fast, secure, and affordable money transfers.

#### My Role: Building Trust Through UX and Frontend Excellence

As a frontend developer, I’ve been responsible for developing and maintaining core user-facing features, working on responsive interfaces, optimizing transactional flows, and ensuring accessibility. I contributed to improving usability across devices and browsers, while reinforcing UI consistency through scalable design systems.

Using Angular, and modular architecture principles, I collaborated closely with backend teams, product managers, and QA to guarantee stable, testable, and high-performing web components. I also helped implement caching strategies and service worker-based optimizations for better user experiences in lower-connectivity areas.

#### Where User-Centered Design Meets Fintech Innovation

Sendsei is more than a remittance service—it's a social enabler. Every decision, from flow structure to button placement, has been rooted in understanding the emotional and practical needs of our users. Our team regularly tested assumptions with real users, iterated on feedback, and adapted features that aligned business KPIs with human outcomes.

#### The Outcome

Sendsei became one of the most intuitive and fastest-growing BCP fintech experiments, launching in record time and gaining trust across migrant communities. My experience here sharpened both my technical skillset and my understanding of how to deliver value in a sensitive, high-impact digital environment.
